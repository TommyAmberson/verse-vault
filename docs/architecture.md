# Architecture

> **Memory model:** the canonical reference is
> [`docs/path-posterior-memory-model.md`](./path-posterior-memory-model.md). It describes the active
> HSRS-state architecture: per-test FSRS state on per-verse atomic bindings, atomic + composite
> cards driven by `Card::tests()` routing, and HSRS-style Bayesian-share decomposition of a single
> card grade across the card's contained tests. The sibling docs ([`graph.md`](./graph.md),
> [`review.md`](./review.md), [`scheduling.md`](./scheduling.md)) cover their own subtopics — the
> verse element index, the single-grade review pipeline, and the per-test scheduler — and defer to
> the canonical spec for memory-model details.

## System overview

verse-vault is structured as:

* **Rust core (`crates/core/`)** — pure algorithm: per-test FSRS state, atomic + composite cards,
  HSRS-style Bayesian-share decomposition, scheduling, sessions. No I/O, no async. Runs the same way
  on any target (native, WASM, mobile).
* **WASM bindings (`crates/wasm/`)** — wraps the core for JavaScript consumers via `wasm-bindgen`.
  Used by the TypeScript server and the browser frontend.
* **Simulation binary (`crates/sim/`)** — offline validation tool. Runs a synthetic learner against
  the core to benchmark behavior.
* **Server (`packages/api/`)** — Hono + Better Auth + Drizzle + better-sqlite3. Hosts the engine,
  handles persistence, auth, and multi-user state. Route groups under `/api/`: `cards`, `sync`,
  `materials` (which also carries the season-schedule routes), `years`, `stats`, `activity`, and the
  account surface (`export`, `import`, `account/progress`).
* **Web client (`apps/web/`)** — Vue 3 + Vite SPA running the WASM engine in-browser. Each grade
  replays locally; an IndexedDB-backed event queue ships batches to `/api/sync/*` on a 5 s
  debounce + on tab hide. Ships as a fat client today; the thin `/api/cards/*` surface is kept for
  tests + transitional callers.
* **Desktop (`apps/web/src-tauri/`)** — Tauri v2 shell wrapping the same Vue + WASM bundle as the
  browser build. **CLI** — planned, not yet started.

The core is the single source of truth for memory modeling. Every platform (server, browser,
desktop) runs the same compiled Rust.

## Client modes

The server exposes two parallel route surfaces over the same engine + event log; both paths go
through the same per-(user, material) lock and share the `review_events` audit trail.

* **Fat client** (`/api/sync/*`): UI downloads the latest snapshot + test states from `/state`, runs
  the WASM engine locally, queues grades + graduations in IndexedDB, and POSTs batches to `/events`
  (with a `snapshotVersion` gate + `clientEventId` dedup). _Drives the Vue web app today._
  Out-of-order arrivals trigger a full-log rebuild via `EngineStore.rebuildFromEvents`; batches
  older than `STALE_MERGE_THRESHOLD` recent server events return a `needsConfirm` envelope so the
  user can review before merging.
* **Thin client** (`/api/cards/*`): legacy per-grade round-trip surface. UI asks the server for the
  next card and submits one grade at a time. _The scheduling and grading endpoints are unused by any
  view — `apps/web/src/api.ts` still exports wrappers for them, but nothing calls them._ One
  endpoint on this surface is not legacy: `GET /api/cards/:cardId` backs `getCardRender`, which
  `engineStore` hits on every render-cache miss. Rendering stays server-side because it needs the
  api.bible passage text, so the fat client computes scheduling locally and still fetches HTML.

Both modes use the same compiled core. The server's event log is the source of truth; a client that
goes offline and submits events later has its events merged by timestamp (or replayed from baseline
when ordering drifts) and the state recomputed.

## Why a TypeScript server?

* The project already shares patterns with `qzr-sheet` (Hono, Better Auth, Drizzle).
* Better Auth has no Rust equivalent for passkeys, OAuth providers, magic links.
* The algorithm complexity lives in Rust (via WASM), not in the server glue. The server is auth,
  persistence, and an HTTP shell around the engine.

## Deployment

Node process on a VPS (not Cloudflare Workers — the engine's path enumeration exceeds Workers' CPU
limits for larger verse sets). See `docs/deployment.md`.
