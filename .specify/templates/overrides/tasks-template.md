# Tasks: [FEATURE NAME]

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/`

**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Follow the constitution's testing principle. Where it calls for a test, the implementation task names the test task or existing test that covers it.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`
- **Mobile**: `api/src/`, `ios/src/` or `android/src/`
- Paths shown below assume single project - adjust based on plan.md structure

<!--
  ============================================================================
  TASK WRITING RULES (project override; constitution principle VII)
  These rules and the constitution override the speckit-tasks skill's
  defaults: tests are not optional where the testing principle calls for
  them, and stories are not ordered Models -> Services -> Endpoints.
  Keep this comment in the generated tasks.md, so commands that add tasks
  later (/speckit-converge) see the same rules.

  - Describe the behaviour, and the test that proves it where the testing
    principle calls for one, not the code. Name a function, signature, option,
    or literal only when the task changes an existing one or the spec,
    data-model.md, or contracts/ already fixes it. Let implementation choose new names; naming the file a change
    lands in is fine.
  - Every decision or write path the feature adds has one owner, named in
    plan.md's "Reuse and Ownership" table. A task that touches it points at that
    owner; never split one rule's implementation across several tasks or files.
  - Reuse first. A task that adds a helper, module, type, or test fixture names
    the existing code it checked and why that doesn't fit. Test tasks extend
    existing fixtures and stubs rather than copying them.
  - No speculative surface: every new production export has a caller the
    constitution accepts, and no task adds an option, reason code, or counter
    that only a test reads.
  - Don't specify framework or library defaults; plan.md records what the
    platform already provides.
  - Name the packages a release bumps and the semver level of each, never the
    resulting version number. The number is set when the bump commit is
    written, from master at that time, and a hotfix landing first takes it.
  - Prefer one task per coherent change over one task per layer (model, then
    service, then endpoint). Split only where tasks can genuinely run or be
    reviewed apart.

<!--
  ============================================================================
  IMPORTANT: The tasks below are SAMPLE TASKS for illustration purposes only.

  The /speckit-tasks command MUST replace these with actual tasks based on:
  - User stories from spec.md (with their priorities P1, P2, P3...)
  - Feature requirements from plan.md
  - Entities from data-model.md
  - Endpoints from contracts/

  Tasks MUST be organized by user story so each story can be:
  - Implemented independently
  - Tested independently
  - Delivered as an MVP increment

  DO NOT keep these sample tasks in the generated tasks.md file.
  ============================================================================

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan
- [ ] T002 Initialize [language] project with [framework] dependencies
- [ ] T003 [P] Configure linting and formatting tools

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

Examples of foundational tasks (adjust based on your project):

- [ ] T004 [Schema change every story needs], via [existing migration tooling]
- [ ] T005 [Shared data or decision every story depends on], owned by [owner from plan.md]
- [ ] T006 [Wiring every story builds on], extending [existing entry point]

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - [Title] (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]

**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works on its own]

### Tests for User Story 1

> **NOTE: Where a task adds a new test, write it first and see it fail.**

- [ ] T007 [P] [US1] Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py
- [ ] T008 [P] [US1] Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [ ] T009 [US1] [Behaviour the story adds], owned by [owner from plan.md] in src/[location]/[file].py, reusing [existing code]; covered by [test task ID or existing test]
- [ ] T010 [US1] [Next coherent change], extending [existing module or fixture] in src/[location]/[file].py; covered by [test task ID or existing test]

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - [Title] (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]

**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works on its own]

### Tests for User Story 2

- [ ] T011 [P] [US2] Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py
- [ ] T012 [P] [US2] Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [ ] T013 [US2] [Behaviour the story adds], owned by [owner from plan.md] in src/[location]/[file].py; covered by [test task ID or existing test]
- [ ] T014 [US2] Integrate with User Story 1 through [its owner] (if needed)

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - [Title] (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]

**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works on its own]

### Tests for User Story 3

- [ ] T015 [P] [US3] Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py
- [ ] T016 [P] [US3] Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [ ] T017 [US3] [Behaviour the story adds], owned by [owner from plan.md] in src/[location]/[file].py; covered by [test task ID or existing test]

**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional

---

[Add more user story phases as needed, following the same pattern]

---

## Phase N: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories

- [ ] TXXX [P] Documentation updates in docs/
- [ ] TXXX [P] Tests the testing principle calls for that no story task covered
- [ ] TXXX Run quickstart.md validation

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- A new test is written, and seen to fail, before the implementation it covers
- An owner from plan.md's "Reuse and Ownership" table before the tasks that call it
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py"
Task: "Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2
   - Developer C: User Story 3
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
