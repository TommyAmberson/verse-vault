# Changelog — `@verse-vault/web`

All notable changes to this package are documented here, following
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Released via `.github/workflows/deploy-web.yml` (Cloudflare Pages, `verse-vault-web`) on every
`version` bump in `apps/web/package.json` that lands on `master`.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.2] — 2026-05-20

### Fixed

* CI: `pnpm/action-setup@v4` errored on redundant version pin (both `with: version: 10` and
  `package.json`'s `packageManager: pnpm@10.7.0`). Dropped the `with` arg; 0.1.1 never reached
  production because of this, so 0.1.2 is the first successful deploy.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-05-20

### Added

* First production deploy to Cloudflare Pages.
* Vue 3 thin client: review, memorize, stats, material, sign-in views.
* Better Auth integration (email/password + Google OAuth via `authClient`).
* Subpath-aware build via `VITE_BASE_PATH` + `VITE_API_BASE` env vars.
* `_redirects` SPA fallback for CF Pages.
