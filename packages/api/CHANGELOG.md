# Changelog — `@verse-vault/api`

All notable changes to this package are documented here, following
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Released via `.github/workflows/deploy-api.yml` (rsync to VPS, atomic symlink-flip, restart
`verse-vault.service`) on every `version` bump in `packages/api/package.json` that lands on
`master`.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.3] — 2026-05-20

### Fixed

* CI: `pnpm deploy` in v10 now requires `--legacy` flag (or the `inject-workspace-packages=true`
  setting). Added `--legacy` to the bundle step. 0.1.3 is the first successful API deploy to the
  VPS.

### Bundled algorithm contract

* `verse-vault-core@0.1.0` — unchanged from 0.1.2 (CI-only fix)
* `verse-vault-wasm@0.1.0` — unchanged from 0.1.2 (CI-only fix)

## [0.1.2] — 2026-05-20

### Fixed

* CI: same `pnpm/action-setup@v4` version-conflict fix as the other deployables. 0.1.2 is the first
  successful API deploy to the VPS.

### Bundled algorithm contract

* `verse-vault-core@0.1.0` — unchanged from 0.1.1 (CI-only fix)
* `verse-vault-wasm@0.1.0` — unchanged from 0.1.1 (CI-only fix)

## [0.1.1] — 2026-05-20

### Added

* First production deploy to the verse-vault API host (VPS, fronted by Cloudflare Tunnel).
* Hono + Better Auth + Drizzle + better-sqlite3 stack on Node 22.
* Route groups under `/api/`: `cards`, `sync`, `materials`, `years`, `stats`, plus `/api/auth/*`
  (Better Auth) and `/health`.
* HSRS engine via `verse-vault-wasm` (per-test FSRS state, Bayesian-share decomposition).
* api.bible cache with 30-day TTL for NKJV verse text composition.
* Drizzle migrations run on every boot; forward-only.
* Litestream → Backblaze B2 continuous replication for the SQLite DB.

### Bundled algorithm contract

* `verse-vault-core@0.1.0` — algorithm/state contract
* `verse-vault-wasm@0.1.0` — JS wire-format contract

(See [`crates/core/CHANGELOG.md`](../../crates/core/CHANGELOG.md) and
[`crates/wasm/CHANGELOG.md`](../../crates/wasm/CHANGELOG.md). Fat clients that sync against this API
must ship matching `core` + `wasm` versions.)
